Description: LUCID version 3, a major update and enhancement from the last version, is more robust, and features more powerful model selection, model visualization, inference based on bootstrap resampling, and implements different integration strategies for analyzing multi-omics data including LUCID early integration, LUCID in parallel, and LUCID in serial. It also incorporates methods to deal with missingness in multi-omics data.
