lucid(
  G,
  Z,
  Y,
  CoG = NULL,
  CoY = NULL,
  family = c("normal", "binary"),
  K = 2,
  lucid_model = c("early", "parallel", "serial"),

}
\arguments{
\item{G}{Exposures, a numeric vector, matrix, or data frame. Categorical variable
should be transformed into dummy variables. If a matrix or data frame, rows
represent observations and columns correspond to variables.}

\item{Z}{Omics data. If "early", an N by M matrix; If "parallel", a list, each element i is a matrix with N rows and P_i features;
If "serial", a list, each element i is a matrix with N rows and p_i features or a list with two or more matrices with N rows and a certain number of features
If "serial", a list, each element is a matrix with N rows or a list with two or more matrices with N rows}

\item{Y}{Outcome, a numeric vector. Categorical variable is not allowed. Binary
outcome should be coded as 0 and 1.}

\item{CoG}{Optional, covariates to be adjusted for estimating the latent cluster.
A numeric vector, matrix or data frame. Categorical variable should be transformed
into dummy variables.}

\item{CoY}{Optional, covariates to be adjusted for estimating the association
between latent cluster and the outcome. A numeric vector, matrix or data frame.
Categorical variable should be transformed into dummy variables.}

\item{family}{Distribution of outcome. For continuous outcome, use "normal";
for binary outcome, use "binary". Default is "normal".}

\item{K}{Number of latent clusters. For lucid_model = "early", number of latent clusters (should be greater or equal than 2).
Either an integer or a vector of integer. If K is a vector, model selection
on K is performed. For lucid_model = "parallel",an integer vector, same length as Z,
if the element itself is a vector, model selection on K is performed;
For lucid_model = "serial", a list, each element is either an integer or an list of integers, same length as Z,
if the smallest element (integer) itself is a vector, model selection on K is performed}

\item{lucid_model}{Specifying LUCID model, "early" for early integration, "parallel" for lucid in parallel,
"serial" for lucid in serial}

\item{Rho_G}{A scalar or a vector. This parameter is the LASSO penalty to regularize
exposures. If it is a vector, \code{lucid} will call \code{tune_lucid} to conduct
model selection and variable selection. User can try penalties from 0 to 1. Work for LUCID early only.}

\item{Rho_Z_Mu}{A scalar or a vector. This parameter is the LASSO penalty to
regularize cluster-specific means for omics data (Z). If it is a vector,
\code{lucid} will call \code{tune_lucid} to conduct model selection and
variable selection. User can try penalties from 1 to 100. Work for LUCID early only.}

\item{Rho_Z_Cov}{A scalar or a vector. This parameter is the graphical LASSO
penalty to estimate sparse cluster-specific variance-covariance matrices for omics
data (Z). If it is a vector, \code{lucid} will call \code{tune_lucid} to conduct
model selection and variable selection. User can try penalties from 0 to 1. Work for LUCID early only.}

\item{verbose_tune}{A flag to print details of tuning process.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed to \code{estimate_lucid}}
