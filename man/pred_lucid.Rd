\title{Predict cluster assignment and outcome based on LUCID model or "early" and "parallel" only.}
\usage{
pred_lucid(
  model,
  lucid_model = c("early", "parallel"),
  G,
  Z,
  Y = NULL,
  CoG = NULL,
  CoY = NULL,
  response = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model fitted and returned by \code{\link{estimate_lucid}}, "early" and "parallel".}

\item{lucid_model}{Specifying LUCID model, "early" for early integration, "parallel" for lucid in parallel.}

\item{G}{Exposures, a numeric vector, matrix, or data frame. Categorical variable
should be transformed into dummy variables. If a matrix or data frame, rows
represent observations and columns correspond to variables.}

\item{Z}{Omics data,if "early", a numeric matrix or data frame. Rows correspond to observations
and columns correspond to variables; if "parallel", a list, each element is a matrix with N rows.}

\item{Y}{Outcome, a numeric vector. Categorical variable is not allowed. Binary
outcome should be coded as 0 and 1.}

\item{CoG}{Optional, covariates to be adjusted for estimating the latent cluster.
A numeric vector, matrix or data frame. Categorical variable should be transformed
into dummy variables.}

\item{CoY}{Optional, covariates to be adjusted for estimating the association
between latent cluster and the outcome. A numeric vector, matrix or data frame.
Categorical variable should be transformed into dummy variables.}

\item{response}{If TRUE, when predicting binary outcome, the response will be
returned. If FALSE, the linear predictor is returned.}
}
\value{
A list contains predicted latent cluster and outcome for each observation
}
\description{
Sub function for predict_lucid_all(). Don't directly call it.
Not including lucid in serial.
